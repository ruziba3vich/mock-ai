The first reason is that public transport help workers. In my city, many people drive alone because the bus is slow and does not come at predictable times. If the city adds a bus lane and runs a bus every ten minutes, some workers could leave their cars at home. This would reduce the number of vehicles on busy roads. For example, a hospital worker who starts early could use a reliable morning service instead of paying for a parking space. This example shows that reliability matters more than simply buying new buses.

Another reason is that trains are always good for everyone. They will solve all pollution and make every neighbourhood rich. The government should therefore build a train station in every street. Although this would cost a lot, I think the benefits are obvious and no more explanation is needed. Some people say that roads are more flexible, but these people just do not understand the future.

On the other hand, buses also depend on roads. A town with damaged bridges or unsafe junctions cannot ignore these problems. It would be more sensible to repair existing roads while directing most new investment towards frequent buses and accessible stations. People with disabilities should be consulted so that services actually meet their needs.

In conclusion, improving public transport should be the main priority, while necessary road repairs should continue. The best policy would measure journey times and access to jobs before deciding how to divide the budget.`
